## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please report it by creating an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kirbylink/java-warp4j/issues). Include as much detail as possible to help in diagnosing and fixing the issue quickly:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any relevant logs or screenshots.
- The version you are using.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! If you have an idea to improve the project, please create an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kirbylink/java-warp4j/issues) with the tag "enhancement" and provide a detailed description of your suggestion:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the enhancement and why it would be useful.
- Any relevant examples or mockups.

### Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome! To ensure a smooth process, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure your code passes the tests.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Submit your pull request.

### Pull Request Process

1. Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainer.
2. Ensure that all tests pass and that your code meets the project's coding standards.
3. The pull request will run through a local CI/CD pipeline. If it passes all checks and is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
4. Depending on the nature of the changes, the pull request may either be directly merged into GitHub or first merged into the local project and then pushed to GitHub with a reference to the pull request.

### Local Pipeline

All pull requests will run through a local pipeline that includes building, testing, and other checks to ensure code quality and functionality. Only pull requests that pass this pipeline will be considered for merging.

## Code Style

Please follow the existing code style in the project. Adhering to a consistent style helps ensure that the code base is easy to read, maintain, and understand.
The code style mainly follows the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Try to avoid comments and Javadoc. Instead, use meaningful names for methods and variables.

## Communication

If you need to get in touch, you can contact the project maintainer through [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/kirbylink/java-warp4j/discussions) or create an issue.
